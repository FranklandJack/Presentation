Introduction:
	- What are we doing?
		- Calculating properties of QM systems.
	- How are we doing it?
		- Using HMC.
	- Aim of project?
		- Problem of isolated modes in probability distribution.
		- Investigate effect of introducing tempering parameter to solve this problem.
	- Motivation for doing this?
		- Would give better approximations of quantities in are QM system.
		- Applications to lattice field theories such as QCD on a lattice where regions of distinct topological charge arise as isolated modes.

Background:
	- QM Path integral = statistical physics canonical distribution function on lattice.
	- QM expectation values in GS = expectation values under canonical distribution on lattice.

Methods:
	- Use Monte Carlo methods to calculate the expectation values.
		- HMC algorithm:
			- Explanation of the steps of the algorithm. 

Results:
	- Show graphs for harmonic oscillator results.
	- Show graphs for anharmonic oscillator results. 
	- Show an example of tunnelling problem and isolated modes.

Tempering:
	- Explain how to incorporate tempering into the algorithm.
	- Explain how it increases the Hamiltonian along the trajectory and that this allows the Markov Chain to move  	
	  between the isolated modes. Show graphs of Hamiltonian on trajectory.
	- Explain how the configurations change as the Hamiltonian increases by including graphs.
	- Explain how the Hamiltonian is often bigger at the end of the trajectory than at the beginning and this is why it 
	  doesn't work?
